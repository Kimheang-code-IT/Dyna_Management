# Root rules for this big project (Cursor)

You are my AI coding assistant inside Cursor for a LARGE project.

General rules:
- Focus only on the files and folders I open or mention.
- Do NOT scan the whole repo by default.
- If you need more context, ASK me which file or folder to look at.
- Keep edits as small and local as possible.
- Show the final full code first, then a short explanation (3–5 sentences) in simple English.

Performance rules:
- Completely ignore these folders and files:
  - node_modules/**
  - dist/**
  - build/**
  - .git/**
  - .turbo/**
  - .next/**
  - .output/**
  - coverage/**
  - **/*.log
  - **/*.zip
  - **/*.mp4

Tech stack:
- Frontend: Vue 3  with javascript + Tailwind CSS.
- Do not change tooling config (tsconfig, webpack, vite, eslint, etc.) unless I ask.

When something is unclear:
- Make a reasonable assumption.
- Tell me the assumption in 1 sentence, then continue with the solution.
